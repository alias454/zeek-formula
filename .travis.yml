# Make sure the instances listed below match up with
# the `platforms` defined in `kitchen.yml`
# NOTE: Please try to select up to six instances that add some meaningful
#       testing of the formula's behaviour. If possible, try to refrain from
#       the classical "chosing all the instances because I want to test on
#       another/all distro/s" trap: it will just add time to the testing (see
#       the discussion on #121).  As an example, the set chosen below covers
#       the most used distros families, systemd and non-systemd and the latest
#       three supported Saltstack versions with python2 and 3.
#       As for `kitchen.yml`, that should still contain all of the platforms,
#       to allow for comprehensive local testing
